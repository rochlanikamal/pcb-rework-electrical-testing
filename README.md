Project Overview:
This project highlights my hands-on work in electrical hardware testing, PCB rework, and component package validation conducted at Lutron Electronics during a critical phase of product development and certification. The focus was on resolving component shortages by reworking existing PCBAs and validating them for UL certification and internal quality standards.

Problem Statement:
During the global supply chain disruption, key components used in dimmers, drivers, and control modules became unavailable or obsolete. To maintain development timelines and ensure compliance with safety standards, I was tasked with:
Identifying alternate components.
Reworking PCBAs to fit different package types (e.g., SOT-23, SOIC, QFP).
Conducting electrical hardware tests on reworked boards to ensure performance and safety.
Supporting qualification for UL and internal reliability testing.

My Contributions:
1. Component Shortage Management
Identified and evaluated alternate parts with similar electrical characteristics.
Coordinated with the design and procurement team to get alternate components approved.
Analyzed datasheets and mechanical footprints for compatibility.

2. PCB Rework and Soldering
Performed precision soldering and desoldering using hot air rework stations and soldering irons.
Modified existing PCB layouts to accommodate alternate packages without design re-spin.
Ensured minimal signal integrity impact during manual modifications.
Captured and documented each rework activity using high-resolution photographs.

3. Hardware Validation and UL Certification Support
Conducted functional testing of reworked PCBAs (e.g., voltage measurements, current draw, signal integrity).
Assisted in UL test preparation and supported in electrical stress testing, hipot, and surge tests.
Logged and analyzed test data to ensure reworked boards met specification and regulatory requirements.

Tools & Skills Used:
Soldering & Rework Equipment: Weller/Saike Hot Air Gun, Multimeter, Oscilloscope
Electrical Testing: Functional Test Setup, Load Simulation, ESD & Surge Testing
Component Engineering: Datasheet analysis, BOM edits, IPC footprint validation
Documentation: Rework logs, test records, image evidence of modifications
